# 7xLabs.Kafka.POC

Proof of concept of automatic trace generation by the Confluent.Kafka package.

The OpenTelemetry documentation indicated that automatic instrumentation for Confluent.Kafka for .NET is in Experimental phase at the time this repository was created.

The idea of ​​the code exposed here is to validate whether this functionality is already available in stable Confluent.Kafka for .NET Core packages.
